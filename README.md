## ✨ Highlights

- 🔊 **List** every active playback & recording device, with the current **Default** and **Communications** defaults clearly marked.
- ⚡ **Switch** the default output/input device by full name, partial name, or device ID — case-insensitive.
- 🔁 **Toggle** a flow between two devices with one command — perfect for a hotkey that flips speakers ↔ headphones.
- 🎚️ **Two default slots, your choice** — target the multimedia **Default Device**, the **Communications** device, or both at once.
- 🖥️ **Interactive picker** — a guided two-column TUI that builds the exact command line for you to copy into scripts.
- 📦 **Single native binary** — Native AOT produces a ~3 MB `as.exe` with **zero .NET runtime dependency**.

## 📥 Install

Grab `as.exe` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and drop it anywhere on your `PATH`.
It's a single self-contained executable — **nothing else to install**.

```powershell
# verify it runs
as --version
```

> 💡 Prefer building it yourself? See [Build from source](#-build-from-source).

## 🚀 Quick start

```powershell
as                                                   # launch the interactive picker
as list                                              # list playback + recording devices
as set --playback "Headphones"                       # set the default playback device
as set --recording "USB Microphone"                  # set the default recording device
as set --playback "Headphones" --recording "USB Mic" # set both in one go
as set --playback "Headset" --communications         # set only the comms default
as set --playback "Speakers" --default               # set only the multimedia default
as toggle --playback "Speakers" "Headphones"         # flip playback between two devices
```

Device matching is **case-insensitive** and accepts a full name, a partial name, or the device ID.

## 🧭 Commands

### `as list`

Lists active devices and marks the current **Default** (`●`) and **Comms** (`●`) defaults.

| Option        | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `--playback`  | List only playback (output) devices |
| `--recording` | List only recording (input) devices |

With no option, both playback and recording devices are listed.

### `as set`

Sets the default playback and/or recording device.

| Option                        | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--playback <name>`           | Name or ID of the playback (output) device to set            |
| `--recording <name>`          | Name or ID of the recording (input) device to set            |
| `--communications`, `--comms` | Set only the default **communication** device                |
| `--default`                   | Set only the **multimedia** default (Console + Multimedia)   |

Provide `--playback`, `--recording`, or both. If neither `--communications` nor
`--default` is given, **every role is set at once**.

### `as toggle`

Flips the default playback and/or recording device **between two devices**. Pass two
names (or IDs) per flow; `toggle` reads the current default and switches to whichever
of the two is *not* currently active — ideal for binding to a single hotkey.

| Option                        | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--playback <a> <b>`          | Two playback (output) devices to toggle between              |
| `--recording <a> <b>`         | Two recording (input) devices to toggle between              |
| `--communications`, `--comms` | Toggle only the default **communication** device             |
| `--default`                   | Toggle only the **multimedia** default (Console + Multimedia)|

Provide `--playback`, `--recording`, or both. The role flags work exactly as they do
for `as set`; omitting them toggles every role at once.

**How the target is chosen:** if the current default is the first device, `toggle`
switches to the second; if it's the second, it switches back to the first; if it's
**neither** (some other device, or nothing), it switches to the **first** device.

```powershell
> as toggle --playback "Speakers" "Headphones"
Toggled playback default and communications device from Speakers to Headphones

> as toggle --playback "Speakers" "Headphones"
Toggled playback default and communications device from Headphones to Speakers
```

### `as interactive`

> Aliases: `as i` — or just run `as` with **no arguments**.

A guided, keyboard-driven picker:

1. **Pick what to change** — *Default device*, *Communication device*, or *Both*.
2. **Pick the devices** — a two-column screen (🔊 Playback · 🎙 Recording). Navigate with
   `↑/↓`, switch columns with `←/→` or `Tab`, and pick *— leave unchanged —* to skip a column.
3. **Copy the command** — a live panel composes the exact CLI command, e.g.
   `as set --playback "Headset Earphone" --recording "Headset Microphone" --communications`,
   ready to paste into a script.
4. Press `Enter` to apply (and print the final command) or `Esc` to go back.

## 🪟 How Windows defaults work

Windows tracks **two independent default device slots** per data flow:

| Slot                          | Roles                  | Used by                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Default Device**            | Console + Multimedia   | Media playback, games, system sounds      |
| **Default Communication Device** | Communications      | Voice/calling apps (Teams, Discord, …)    |

Use `--default` to target the multimedia slot, `--communications` (`--comms`) for the
communications slot, or omit both to set every role at once.

## 🔧 Build from source

The project targets **.NET 10** and is configured for **Native AOT**
(`<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>`), so `dotnet publish` produces a single, fully native
`as.exe` (~3 MB) with **no .NET runtime dependency**.

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release
```

The executable is written to:

```text
bin/Release/net10.0-windows/win-x64/publish/as.exe
```

### Prerequisites

Native AOT compiles and links to native code, so the **build machine** (not machines that
merely run `as.exe`) needs:

- The **Desktop development with C++** workload (MSVC `link.exe`), and
- The **Windows 11 SDK** (provides `advapi32.lib`, etc.).

Publish from a *Developer Command Prompt / Developer PowerShell for VS* (or run
`vcvars64.bat` first) so the linker can find the MSVC and Windows SDK libraries.

## 🧪 Tests

Unit tests live in [`AudioSwitcher.Tests/`](AudioSwitcher.Tests) (xUnit) and cover the pure
logic of the app: `CliFormat` (labels, icons, role-target resolution, the copy-pasteable
`set` command-line builder, and innermost-error extraction), device name/ID matching in
`AudioDeviceService` (exact wins over partial, ambiguous partial matches are rejected), the
toggle selection logic and two-value flag parser, the reported version, and the interactive
picker helpers (`Wrap`, `BuildItems`, `InitialCursor`).
The Core Audio COM layers require a real audio endpoint and are exercised manually.

```powershell
dotnet test AudioSwitcher.slnx
```

## 🚢 Releases (CI)

Pushing a semantic-version tag automatically builds, tests, and publishes `as.exe` via
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), attaching the binary, a
zip, and SHA-256 checksums to a GitHub Release.

```powershell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow runs on `windows-latest` (which ships the MSVC toolchain and Windows SDK needed
for Native AOT), **gates the release on the test suite**, and derives the build version from
the tag. It can also be triggered manually from the **Actions** tab to validate a build
without creating a release.

## 🗂️ Project structure

The code is organised by responsibility:

| Path          | Contents                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Interop/`    | Native Core Audio COM glue: `NativeEnums`, `NativeTypes`, `ComInterfaces`, `CoreAudio`.    |
| `Audio/`      | Device model and logic: `AudioDevice`, `RoleTarget`, `AudioDeviceService`.                 |
| `Cli/`        | Command-line layer: `CliRouter`, `CliFormat`, and the `List`/`Set`/`Toggle`/`Interactive` commands. |
| `Program.cs`  | Entry point — hands the arguments to `CliRouter`.                                          |
| `AudioSwitcher.Tests/` | xUnit test project.                                                              |
